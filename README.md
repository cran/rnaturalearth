# rnaturalearth

An R package to hold and facilitate interaction with [Natural
Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) map data.

This package provides :

-   access to a pre-downloaded subset of Natural Earth v4.1.0
    (March 2018) vector data commonly used in world mapping

-   easy subsetting by countries and regions

-   functions to download other Natural Earth vector and raster data

-   a simple, reproducible and sustainable workflow from Natural Earth
    data to rnaturalearth enabling updating as new versions become
    available

-   clarification of differences in world maps classified by countries,
    sovereign states and map units

-   consistency with Natural Earth naming conventions so that
    rnaturalearth users can use Natural Earth documentation

-   data in ‘sf’ or ‘sp’ formats

The [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) website
structures vector data by scale, category and type. These determine the
filenames of downloads. rnaturalearth uses this structure to facilitate
download (like an API).

## Install rnaturalearth

Install from CRAN :

``` r
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
```

or install the development version from GitHub using
[devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools).

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearth")
```

Data to support much of the package functionality are stored in two data
packages that you will be prompted to install when required if you do
not do so here.

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthdata")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")
```

## First usage

Here using `sp::plot` as a simple, quick way to plot maps. Maps could
also be made with `ggplot2`, `tmap` or other options. All retrieval
functions accept an argument `returnclass = "sf"` to return package `sf`
(Simple Features) objects.

``` r
library(rnaturalearth)
The legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning this package
will retire shortly. Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports on
https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html for details.
This package is now running under evolution status 0 
Support for Spatial objects (`sp`) will be deprecated in {rnaturalearth} and will be removed in a future release of the package. Please use `sf` objects with {rnaturalearth}. For example: `ne_download(returnclass = 'sf')`
library(sp)

# world countries
sp::plot(ne_countries())
Warning: The `returnclass` argument of `ne_download()` sp as of rnaturalearth 1.0.0.
ℹ Please use `sf` objects with {rnaturalearth}, support for Spatial objects
  (sp) will be removed in a future release of the package.
This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was
generated.

## Introductory vignette

``` r

```

## To download Natural Earth data not already in the package

There are a wealth of other data available at the [Natural
Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) website. `rnaturalearth` has
functions to help with download of these data.

The data available are outlined in the two tables below and online
[here](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/).


    category   cultural 

    category   physical 

Specify the `scale`, `category` and `type` of the vector you want as in
the examples below.

``` r
# lakes
lakes110 <- ne_download(scale = 110, type = "lakes", category = "physical")
sp::plot(lakes110)

# rivers
rivers50 <- ne_download(
  scale = 50,
  type = "rivers_lake_centerlines",
  category = "physical",
  returnclass = "sf"
)

library(ggplot2)
library(sf)

ggplot(rivers50) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Details of different country definitions and scales

``` r
vignette("what-is-a-country", package = "rnaturalearth")
```

## Reproducible download of Natural Earth data into the package

[Script](https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearthdata/blob/master/data-raw/data_download_script.r)
used to get data into the accompanying data packages.

## Potential future work

### Potential additional data

-   Country synonyms lookup
    -   dataframe with ISO3 and country synonyms
    -   similar to
        <https://github.com/AndySouth/rworldmap/blob/master/data/countrySynonyms.rda>
-   Country larger regions lookup
    -   dataframe with ISO3 and membership of different regional
        groupings, e.g. continent, least developed countries etc.
    -   similar to
        <https://github.com/AndySouth/rworldmap/blob/master/data/countryRegions.rda>

### Potential additional functions

-   facilitate joining of user data to country boundaries

    -   similar to
        <https://github.com/AndySouth/rworldmap/blob/master/R/joinCountryData2Map.R>
    -   … but with a better name
    -   similar allowing of join by ISO codes or names, with attempted
        synonym matching
    -   similar reporting of country joining success and failure

-   facilitate subsetting by country groupings

    -   e.g. least developed countries etc.
